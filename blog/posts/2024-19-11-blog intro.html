	<p style='font-size:24px'>I'm not dead!</p>
	<p>and now I have a blog section on my site to prove it!</p>
	<p>mostly gonna use this for commentary on comic updates i think, <i>(y'know on the rare occasion those happen)</i>
	but it <i>is</i> nice to have a place i can just get my thoughts down and fuck around with some arbitrary css and html</p>
	<p>look at this: <img src='/images/DogWizardSmall.gif' style='width:16px;height:16px;'> can't put a dog gif in the middle of my text on tumblr now can i?</p>
	<p>anyway put a whole bunch of art on the art section of the site. mostly godfeels stuff. check it out if you want</p>
