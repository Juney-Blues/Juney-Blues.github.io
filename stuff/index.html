      <p>i've been obsessed with the musical stylings of this guy for like 2 years straight and counting lmao</p>
      <p>The combination of incredibly catchy beat pop tunes combined with the often nonsensical abstract lyrics appeals to me on a visceral level</p>
      <p>i have been hyperfixating on the album <a href="https://talkshowboy.bandcamp.com/album/watch-as-i-perform-my-own-tracheotomy">WATCH AS I PERFORM MY OWN TRACHEOTOMY</a> for a long ass fucking time and have listened to it more times than i'd care to admit... I even named my comic after it lmao.</p>
      <p>I'm like 80% sure he runs <a href="https://ilovemdma.com/">I Love Melbourne Dance Music Association</a> too but w/e too lazy to check</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/">HOMESTUCK</a></h3>
      <p>a multimedia experience, a modern epic, a rube goldberg machine for figuring out your sexuality and gender, and a guaranteed way of making you 100% more annoying.</p>
      <p>originally hosted on Andrew Hussie's site, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php">MS PAINT ADVENTURES DOT COM</a> (which has unfortunately fallen into disrepair) then hosted at <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">HOMESTUCK.COM</a>, (which has ALSO fell into disrepair, despite ending in 2016, which at time of writing is not even 7 years ago)</p> 
      <p>the best way of reading it nowadays is certainly The Unofficial Homestuck Collection (created by <a href="https://twitter.com/Bamboshu">BAMBOSH</a> and Linked Above)</p>
      <p>it's about 8000 pages of the stupidest bullshit you'll ever read, and despite, or maybe BECAUSE of that, I recommend it unironically and wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>the comic (justifiably) gets a lot of flack, for a VARIETY of reasons, but fuck it, it's unironically good anyway.</p>

      <p>Acclaimed Video Essayist (probably, i haven't watched her stuff unfortunately) <a href="https://twitter.com/hmsnofun">SARAH ZEDIG</a> dares to ask the question, "what if the main character of homestuck was a transgender vriska kinnie struggling with the horrors of being alive? and also she has awesome lesbian sex and is plural maybe and also it becomes a space opera." and the result is fucking awesome and completely shattered my egg.</p>
      <p>it's SWEET as FUCK, and if the writing alone wasn't enough to trans my gender then these illustrations by <a href="https://girlpillz.com/">GIRLPILLZ</a> would've done it for sure</p>
